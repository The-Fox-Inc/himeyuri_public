## Little History
Himeyuri came about as an idea from *TwinShadow*/*TwinDragon* as a mascot for the Celestial Fox Game Streams and acts as the Discord Bot for the Discord server. If you'd like to join it, feel free to click the Discord button at the top!

## Repository?
*Himeyuri* is based on [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot), an open source Discord bot released under GPLv3 and is hosted by *TwinShadow* as it's own instance. It is a versatile bot, and this repository will be used to house information regarding the bot, what it can do, and possible features anyone would like to see.

The main purpose is to keep track of various little informational bits of pieces for embeds that you see on the Discord server, be it grammar issues, new embeds, and small little glitches that may arise.

## Commands
You can find her commands on this lovely dashboard made by *Neuro Assassin*: [Himeyuri's Dashboard](https://dash.shadowhime.net)

**NOTE:** The link does not work as the dashboard is not public as of yet.

## Problems / Issues
Should any problem arise, feel free to reach out to TwinShadow on Discord, even in the #general channel is fine. If you're comfortable with GitHub, you're also welcome to create an [Issue Ticket](https://github.com/The-Fox-Inc/himeyuri_public/issues/new/choose) using one of the templates that pertains to the problem.
